Databases:
SQL - Structured Query Language (MySQL, PostgreSQL...)
    - Relational
      *MySQL
        - More Mature
	- Table Structure
	- Requires a Schema
	- Great with Relationships
	- Scales Vertically



NoSQL - Not only Structured Query Language (MongoDB, Redis...)
      - Non-Relational
      	*MongoDB
	  - Shiny and New
	  - Document Structure
	  - More Flexible to Change
	  - Not Great with Complex Relationships
	  - Horizontally Scalable
